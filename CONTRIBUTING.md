# Contributing Guidelines

DevStaff is an open community for developers in Crete. We want everyone to be able to contribute! 

## Meetup Topics
We are open to proposals for new topics in the upcoming meetups. We are also open for you to vote on the topics you would like to hear / chat about. 
Here's how: 
* We use GitHub Issues with the 'Topics' label to indicate topic suggestions. 
* You will already find some of the proposed topics under the issues. Open a new issue if you can't find your favourite topic there.
* Upvote the topic you like by using thumbs up ( :+1: ) 
* For topics with a lot of votes, you can fork and open a new PR with a new line in the README.md including the date and topic of the meet up. 
* One of the maintainers will merge the PR once the topic & dates are finalized. Issue will be closed at that point. 

## Community 
Please feel free to propose ANY changes you like to our community, to our workflow, to our meetups (location, setup, time / day of week, etc.) by opening an issue first, for discussion, and a PR including your proposed change, if applicable. This is an open community so all suggestions are welcome!! 
The maintainers are simply there to ensure the community guidelines are upheld and to ensure everything runs smoothly. 

## Repo Maintenance
Maintainers of this repo are required to uphold the 4-eyes principle. (No PR should get merged unless two maintainers have confirmed / given a :+1: )

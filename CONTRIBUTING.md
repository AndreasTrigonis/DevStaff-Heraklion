# Contributing Guidelines

DevStaff is an open community for developers in Crete. We want everyone to be able to contribute! 

## Meetup Topics

The DevStaff Meetups take place every 2nd Thursday of each month and the subject is picked by a simple majority vote by community members. 

Here's how that works:
* The Org Team gets together every so often (in (Org Meetups)[https://github.com/devstaff-crete/DevStaff-Heraklion#org-meetups] ) where they short-list (usually) 5 topics for the community to vote on. The top 3 are then scheduled for the next 3 months, depending on speaker availability. 

One of the hardest problems for all meetups is to find speakers, and a community vote for the most popular subjects makes things even more difficult (we have to find potential speakers for 5 subjects, vs. just the 3 next ones). Yet, we want the community to have the final say, that we take on the extra work. 

For each topic that is proposed to be short-listed:
* there MUST be at least 2 potential speakers and 
* there SHOULD be a GitHub issue with a short description of what the topic is about (this community members decide on whether to vote for it or not). 

Voting NO LONGER happens on GitHub issues. It happens on (Meetup.com polls)[https://www.meetup.com/devstaff/polls/?op=pastlist] ! 

However, you might notice there are :thumbsup: icons on several issues, however this is mainly a remnant of the first 2 years of devstaff meetups when voting used to happen on GitHub. (Some of our community members)[https://github.com/kabitakis/github-analytics/graphs/contributors] even open sourced (a tool for counting votes and :thumbsup: on GitHub issues)[https://github.com/kabitakis/github-analytics] (either as reaction, or as comment, limiting to one per author), which is still available at https://analytics.devstaff.gr/. 


## How to start a Hack Session
* Anyone can start a Hack Session.
* It's a good idea to have found at least one other interested member before opening an issue.
* The issue MUST contain:
  * 'hack session' in its title
  * A host
  * A proposed place
  * A proposed date
  * A limit on attendees (I think 8 is a reasonable number to begin with)
  * Some prerequisites such as attendees experience, tools to be installed, tutorials to be followed before the session etc.
* It's also suggested to create a meetup.com event for the session.
* Note: we are still looking for the best way to do this. We may keep the issues, the meetup events or both. In any case, any suggestions would be appreciated.

## Community 
Please feel free to propose ANY changes you like to our community, to our workflow, to our meetups (location, setup, time / day of week, etc.) by opening an issue first, for discussion, and a PR including your proposed change, if applicable. This is an open community so all suggestions are welcome!!

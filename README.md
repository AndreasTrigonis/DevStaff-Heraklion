## A developer Community Gathering in Crete

So, there's a lot of us, devs, here in Crete... 

Yet, we hardly ever get together in large groups, or even know each other -- somewhat strange for our small community, we hope you'll agree. 

DevStaff is an attempt at bringing us all together for informal chats about what we're all passionate about: technology and software. 

* *Don't know where to start?* Are you new to git and meetup? Here is a short intro about the tools we use: [StartHere!](StartHere.md)

* *You just want to join the group?* Great!

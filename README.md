# DevStaff
## A developer Community Gathering in Crete

So, there's a lot of us, devs, here in Crete... 

Yet, we hardly ever get together in large groups, or even know each other -- somewhat strange for our small community, we hope you'll agree. 

DevStaff is an attempt at bringing us all together for informal chats about what we're all passionate about: technology and software.  

## Your Mission 
*(should you choose to accept it)*

Join the meet up, learn, teach, speak your mind, sharpen your skills, share the knowledge and help us build a community where devs can openly exchange ideas ! 
Discuss issues you've faced, discover new & better ways of working (together), chat about tech (geeky) stuff, help others!

Join us [now] (http://www.meetup.com/DevStaff-A-Developer-Community-Gathering-In-Crete/)!

# Giveaways
From time to time Devstaff has the opportunity to perform some giveaways during the meetups. The prizes are provided by [sponsors](https://github.com/devstaff-crete/DevStaff-Heraklion/blob/master/Sponsors.md) in return of advertising.

Here we describe the process, the tools and the rules we use for these giveaways.

# Prizes list
All prizes will be written down at each meetup's announcement at [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/devstaff/). Moreover, at the intro presentation, when sponsors are presented, each prize will be explicitly mentioned as far as the type, the amount of prizes and the sponsor of each one.

# Participants eligibility
All participants of a meetup are eligible for the raffling process. Org team member's that atend the meetup (we prefer to provide more prizes to the community and have a chance to win them rather than benefit things as org teams members ðŸ˜‰), speaker(s) as well as meetup's attendees will participate in the raffling process. The participants of a meetup are the members that have joined our meetup's place (in case of physical meetups) or our communication tool (in case of remote meetups).

# Raffle Process
During the meetup (especially during the intro and at the end of each meetup) a link (to a shared Google Sheet file) will be shared where they will be able to add their name & email in order to participate at the raffling process. A number will be assigned to each participant and then we shall use the [random.org](https://www.random.org/) to generate one number per giveaway prize. Each participant's unique number that corresponds to the random number will win the prize. All prizes will be given in the order mentioned at the top of the sheet with all participants' names.  

The whole raffle process described at this step will take place during the end of the meetup in front of (or live) all participants.

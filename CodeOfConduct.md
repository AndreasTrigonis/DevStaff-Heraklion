# Code of Conduct
Every community has some rules - below you will find our take on what we expect from our members. The Code of Conduct is an open and living document. Please feel free to open a Pull Request if you feel some changes should be made. 

**DevStaff** is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from our meetups at the discretion of the organizers. 

## Guidelines
Please be careful in the words and phrases that you choose when communicating with others. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. If you think your conversation is making another community member uncomfortable, try to make amends and move forward. Avoid using colloquialisms or words and phrases that may have subjective connotations, especially for non-native speakers.

Here is a non-exhaustive of general guidelines:

* Be welcoming, inclusive, friendly, and patient at all times.
* Be considerate.
* Be respectful.
* Be professional.

Always keep in mind that:

* Disagreements happen, but should not be an excuse for poor behavior and bad manners. When disagreements do happen, we will work together to solve them effectively in a way that ensures everyone's success. If you find yourself feeling frustrated, take a step back from the keyboard.
* Not everyone will understand jokes, sarcasm, oblique references, colloquialisms, or euphemisms in the same what you do. Always try to empathize with the the other parties and recognize they may come from a different background and interpret words differently than you.
* Sexist, racist, or other prejudicial or exclusionary comments are never welcome in the DevStaff community.

## Unacceptable Behaviour
Harassment and other exclusionary behavior are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Violent threats or language directed against another person.
* Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
* Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
* Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
* Any physical violence or intimidation, threatened or acted on, is a serious offense.

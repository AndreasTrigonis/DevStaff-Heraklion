# What is DevStaff?

So, there's a lot of us, devs, here in Crete... 

Yet, we hardly ever get together in large groups, or even know each other -- somewhat strange for our small community, we hope you'll agree. 

DevStaff is an attempt at bringing us all together for informal chats about what we're all passionate about: _technology_ and _software_. The goal is to make Crete a better place for devevelopers to live and work in.

## Interested?

Join the meet up, learn, teach, speak your mind, sharpen your skills, share the knowledge and help us build a community where devs can openly exchange ideas ! 
Discuss issues you've faced, discover new & better ways of working (together), chat about tech (geeky) stuff, help others!


## The tools

The main tool for organizing our meetings is *meetup.com*. The first step is head [there](http://www.meetup.com/DevStaff-A-Developer-Community-Gathering-In-Crete/) and join the group. You will get notifications about up-comming meetups.

We found *github* to be very convenient for organizing our topics and voting for meetups. 
If you are new to github, don't worry. This is a great chance to start using it! 
Our topic voting method is simple, head to the [issues](https://github.com/devstaff-crete/DevStaff-Heraklion/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ATopics), find one or more talk topics that you like and vote for them by writing a comment with a `:+1:` in it. Each topic is voted two months before the meetup date.

Confused? We can help. Ask a question on our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/devstaff-crete/DevStaff-Heraklion). There is always somebody around to help. 

Want to learn a bit more about git? Our first meetup was about git. You can find the presentations that offer a short intro [here](https://github.com/devstaff-crete/meetup01-Git/blob/master/README.md). All the presentations from past meetups are uploaded on their own repos, you can [check them out](https://github.com/devstaff-crete).

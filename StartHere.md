# What is DevStaff?

So, there's a lot of us, devs, here in Crete... 

> Yet, we hardly ever get together in large groups, or even know each other -- somewhat strange for our small community, we hope you'll agree. 


_This ^^ is what we wrote 6 years back. There's now more than 1,100 devs in our [meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/devstaff/)._


DevStaff is an attempt at bringing us all together for informal chats about what we're all passionate about: _technology_ and _software_. Our goal is to make Crete a better place for developers to live and work in!

## Interested?

Join the meet up, learn, teach, speak your mind, sharpen your skills, share the knowledge and help us build a community where devs can openly exchange ideas ! 

Discuss issues you've faced, discover new & better ways of working (together), chat about tech (geeky) stuff, help others!

## Suggest / Vote for Meetups

We found GitHub to be very convenient for organizing our topics and voting for meetups. 

If you are new to GitHub, don't worry. This is a great chance to start using it! 

Our topic voting method is simple, every quarter, we send a topic poll, on our [MeetUp Page](https://www.meetup.com/devstaff/), containing 5 or more topics. There, you rate all topics from 1 to 10, based on how much you prefer each topic to be in the next three. When the poll closes, the top three posts that have speakers are selected, and then presented in the next 3 meetups. This is a rule of thumb: changes can be made by the Org Team when required, including, but not limited to, opportunities for collaboration with other MeetUps, expert speakers in Crete, etc. But how does the Org Team select which topics will make it into the poll? It's simple: it looks in the Issues page of this project, and finds proposed issues with speakers. So if you want to propose a topic for the vote, go ahead and open a new Issue with the topic tag! If you can be a speaker in that, or any other topic, add a :speaker: (`:speaker:`) comment, so we know you are available to make a short presentation on this topic, along with other members of our community! There are not many requirements, and it's not something that you commit to for life. If you feel like you have anything to say, don't be afraid, add the emoji, and when this topic comes to a vote, we'll contact you, to see if you're still up for it, and can make a presentation about it in our meetup!

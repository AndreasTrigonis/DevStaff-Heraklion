# What is DevStaff?

So, there's a lot of us, devs, here in Crete... 

> Yet, we hardly ever get together in large groups, or even know each other -- somewhat strange for our small community, we hope you'll agree. 

_This ^^ is what we wrote 2 years back. There's now more than 550 devs in our [meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/DevStaff-A-Developer-Community-Gathering-In-Crete/)._

DevStaff is an attempt at bringing us all together for informal chats about what we're all passionate about: _technology_ and _software_. Our goal is to make Crete a better place for developers to live and work in!

## Interested?

Join the meet up, learn, teach, speak your mind, sharpen your skills, share the knowledge and help us build a community where devs can openly exchange ideas ! 

Discuss issues you've faced, discover new & better ways of working (together), chat about tech (geeky) stuff, help others!

We found *github* to be very convenient for organizing our topics and voting for meetups. 
If you are new to github, don't worry. This is a great chance to start using it! 

Our topic voting method is simple, head to the [issues](https://github.com/devstaff-crete/DevStaff-Heraklion/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ATopics), find one or more talk topics that you like and vote for them by writing a comment with a `:+1:` in it. Each topic is voted two months before the meetup date.

## Join the chat
We have a slack group where you can find the latest tech news, interesting articles, random pieces of information and a lot of heated discussions! Drop an email to [info@devstaff.gr](mailto:info@devstaff.gr?subject:Slack Invite), so we can send you an invite.
